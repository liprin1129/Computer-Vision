    "We don't actually use pinhole cameras. Instead, we use lenses. Lenses have the notion of focus. In general, lenses are designed so that all the points at a particular distance away will all be focused to the same point on the film or on the recording medium.\n",

    "One of the challenges there is that another point that's at a different distance away, so here the blue point on the tree, they're not all going to be focused at that point. They're going to be sort of spread out a little bit. In fact, that spread is referred to sometimes as the circle of confusion.\n",

    "- lenses have an optical axis along which light passes straight through unbent. \n",
    "- light that comes in parallel are all bent to the same point. That's referred to as the focal point. \n",
    "- in order to reduce the amount of spread of things, lenses also have an aperture. But now the aperture, instead of being just a single point, is restricting the set of rays that are coming in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all lenses were cut out of parts of spheres, because if we understood the mechanics of that and were easy to make, and to be able to do the math. But these days there are many of what are called aspherical elements because it's all computer modeling."
