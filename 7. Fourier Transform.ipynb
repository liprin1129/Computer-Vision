    "Suppose that $B=\\{v_1, \\cdots, v_n\\}$ is a finite subset of a vector space $V$ over a _field_ $F$ (such as the _real_ or _complex numbers_ $R$ or $C$). Then $B$ is a basis if it satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear independence: for all constants $a_1, \\cdots, a_n \\in F$, if $a_1 v_1 + \\cdots + a_n v_n = 0$, then necessarily $a_1=\\cdots=a_n=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spanning property: for every $x$ in $V$, it is possible to choose $a_1, \\cdots, a_n \\in F$ such that $x=a_1 v_1 + \\cdots + a_n v_n = 0$.\n",

    "If we had a basis set for images, that could probably useful for analysis, especially for linear systems because we could consider each basis component independently. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we think of an image as just being a single point in a very large space.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier1.png\" width=\"500px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "But, it's really not a very helpful basis set, because each one of these basis vectors is just a single pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can see any image in terms of how quickly it varies in different directions. \n",

    "Fourier said in 1807 that __any periodic function can be rewritten as a weighted sum of sines and cosines of different frequences (Fourier Transform)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other world, we could make any repeated pattern, doesn't matter what it looks like, as long as it eventually repeats, using sines and cosines. \n",

    "The idea is that if we have a signal, the signal has as its building blocks these sinusoids, and if we add enough of them, we could get whatever component we want. \n",

    "Which of these encondes the notion of a coarse signal versus a fine signal? It's going to be the frequency. So as we change the frequency, as that number gets bigger, essentially the thing wiggled more quickly.\n",

    "If we really wanted a square wave, what we do is we keep adding these odd frequencies. \n",
    "Then, how can we get sort of a sharp boundary using just smooth sinusoids?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the original picture.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier4.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "And now we take that original one and add in something that wiggles at 5 times $f$, and we see that we're getting closer yet to a square wave. \n",

    "and what comes after the 9, \n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier7.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can see is that we're getting closer and closer to having this as perfect square wave. \n",
    "\n",
    "And in fact, we can show that a square wave can just be written as this infinite sum of these frequencies, and the amount of power we need goes down as the frequency increases.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier8.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what are the sinusoidal components that go into making up this image?\n",
    "\n",
    "## (3) Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the idea, any signal, certainly any periodic signal, can be made up of a sum of sinusoids. That means __we can transform our image from signal that's something a function of time, or just of space, to know what is is in terms of its frequency.__ This's called the Fourier transform. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier9.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "How can $F$ hold both amplitude and phase? Cause remember, $f(x)$ is just the value of $F$, so it's a number. $F(\\omega)$ is going to be amplitude and phase. How can we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "$F$ is actually a complex number. \n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier10.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "Basically, $F(\\omega)$ is made up of two parts; a real part and then what's referred to as an imaginary part. And the maginitude of a complex number is just the square root of the sum of the two elements. And the pahse; the relationship between these, is going to be wiritten as this way. So the real part(even) is going to be the $\\cos$ part, and the the imaginary part(odd) will be the $\\sin$ part.\n",

    "#### 1) Computing Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "When we do a Fourier transform, all we're doing is computing a basis set.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier11.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this is true? \n",
    "The product of some negative and positive values together is going to cancel each other out, and that sort of a hand wavy way of saying that the entire integral is going to be 0 as long as $a$ does no equal $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Example\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier12.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier13.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",

    "#### 3) Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier14.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "$F(u)$ is the frequency spectrum, or it can be said that it's frequency of $f$ of $\\omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) Inverse Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier15.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "If we tell what all of the sinusoids are, if I sum them all up at some location $x$, and I sum up over all the sinusoids, I can recover the original signal. And That's called the inverse Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5) Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "For this integral to exist (this Fourier transform), we don't actually want infinites. \n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier18.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "__The Fourier function is integralble, if we take its absolute value.__\n",
    "\n",
    "## (4) Frequency Spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency in general can be thought of going from minus infinity to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier16.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said before, typically we're going to worry about the magnitude of the power. And so we just take the sum of the squares screw it up and this would be the power. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we combined the real part and the imaginary part to make power, I can take a look at the power spectrum from different kinds of signals.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier17.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "- the sinosoid just has power there's two peaks right, regardless of the phase. (the sum of the square root of is going to give us those two peaks.)\n",
    "- in the square wave, the power falls off as frequency goes up. \n",
    "- if we take asignal out of some sort of typical natural image, or typical natural signal, we tend to find the spectra falling off, and that's just is a property of how images are formed by looking at tings, in terms of natural images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (5) Fourier Transform to Fourier Series\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrete Fourier transform is what we have to do when we want to start doing things in computers, because after all we don't have continuous sinals, we only have discrete values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7/Fourier19.png\" width=\"350px\">\n",
    "Instead of now thinking of frequency as how quickly it wiggles in terms of time, it's sort of, how quickly we wiggle over the entire length of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $k$ is written as, it's the number of cycles per period of the signal, or per period of the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "This only makes sense essentially from 0 up to $\\frac{N}{2}$.\n",
